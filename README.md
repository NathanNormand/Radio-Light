# Radio-Light
Radio controlled lights to be used for visibility lines
Start date 9/10/2022

The basic principle for this project is to have visibility lights every 50 meters on a string stretching long distances, 1 mile plus. To acheive this each light will be a self contained unit including a solar panel, battery, radio, and light. Each board is currently using a 950Mhz radio to send light signals to each neighbor in a daisy chain configuration. 

This to written for an Adafruit 32u4 RFM69HCW 915mhz radio board
